# plotter-pen-width-test

This repo is for exploring [vsk.penWidth](https://vsketch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/vsketch/index.html#vsketch.Vsketch.penWidth) from the [vsketch](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch) library.

I was unsure what penwidth I wanted to use for various pens so I created this repo to explore that.
